# Mart-Data-Assets
Creating a data asset  that enables its user to transfer their data from one regional application to another without the need of re-registration.

#Inspiration

In today's world there are a lot of local applications that provide groceries regionally. If a person moves to a new region they have re-enter their data in  a different application available for that region or use big companies like amazon where they cannot directly support their local shops.


#Mode of Action

 With Mart Data Assets we want the user to enter their data once and forget about it. Using OCEAN-AI we are able to create digital assets in which all the companies are able to access the user-data. This allows local application to grow better and reduce the power and control of large-scale businesses. Their contact information, dietary preferences can be stored as a data asset and the user can decide when and to whom they want you share this data to.
